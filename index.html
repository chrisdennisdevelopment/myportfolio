        <p>
            Well, I hail from Philadelphia, PA (go Eagles!).  I'm 29 years young and married to a beautiful woman, Aline.
            No kids yet, but I see some in the near future! We love to travel outside of the US to experience new places 
            and cultures.  My wife is from Brazil, so we get to go there once a year to see her family and different places
            within the country.  I am also slowly, but surely, learning to speak Portuguese!<br><br>
            I also love working out, running, hiking, camping, and basically anything that has to do with the outdoors and nature.
            On my free-time I enjoy cooking, reading an educational book, listening to music, playing video games (PS4), and binge-watching Netflix shows.

                    <p>

                        I am highly trained in HTML5 and build every website with
                        semantic markup that is structured to make sense to anybody
                        viewing it.

                    <p>

                        CSS is one of my favorite languages to code and I am constantly learning more.
                        I create clean stylesheets to bring designs to life in a fluid and responsive way.

                    <p>

                        Javascript is something I enjoy continually learning. It is the programming that 
                        makes a website function to it's peak ability.

        <h1>Front-End Development</h1>
        <p>
        <i>HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the languages I'm fluent in.</i>
        I was the type of kid that would rather teach myself HTML than play video games. 
        I've been teaching myself coding since I was little and have tweaked my skills
        throughout the years.  I will provide clean and responsive code behind the scenes
        of your website while staying ADA compliant.
        </p>    
    </div>
    <div id="second-column">
        <h1>I got Style</h1>
        <p>
        <i>That was a CSS joke.</i>
        Remember, I am a developer, not a designer. But hey, that doesn't mean I don't have style!
        My style is creating fluid and responsive websites with a modern and simple look. Aestetics 
        and functionality are the keys to making the content easily conveyed to the user.  Whatever
        your message, I'll make sure it gets delivered in a beautiful and thoughtful way no matter
        what device your users are on.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="third-column">
        <h1>Customer Care</h1>
        <p>
        I am a very customer centric professional with years of customer service experience.
        Yes, the customer is always right, however, sometimes the customer may want a different perspective.
        As a developer, I will work with you to focus on your needs and goals while offering input and 
        suggestions from the mind of a developer.  We will stay engaged every step of the way until you 
        are satisfied! Let's build something great together!
